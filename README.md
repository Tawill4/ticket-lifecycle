In this project, following the installation and configuration of osTicket. I observed the life cycle of creating a ticket as an end user, and then working the ticket as an agent.. so I created a ticket as one of the users I created in the previous project. This was a ticket involving the online banking portal being down.

I then logged into John, one of the agents I created in osTicket. and Observed the ticket that was created.

Since this is a very important issue that affects the company very directly, I assigned it to Sev-A SLA so it gets done first.

<p>
This being an issue with the online portion of banking... I assigned it to the online banking team where john AND jane are both members. This means both agents can see and work it to completion.

</p>
<p>
To get a better understanding of osTicket and the internals of created tickets, I messed around with the internal notes/replies within the tickets.. I used this is give updates to the person who created the ticket, as well as the other people who can work on the ticket (people in online banking).

</p>
<p>
After "finding a solution" to the problem ticket, all that was left to do was close the ticket.. So I updated the status from "open" to "resolved" and gave a quick explanation of the cause and solution of the issue.
